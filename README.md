# Breast Cancer Prediction System

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant. It was built using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **AWS EC2**.  
The goal is to show how a machine learning model can be trained, turned into an API, and deployed online.

##  Features
- Machine learning model trained on a breast cancer dataset  
- FastAPI endpoint for real-time predictions  
- Deployed on AWS EC2  
- Easy-to-understand structure

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **FastAPI**  
- **Scikit-Learn**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **AWS EC2**

## How It Works
1. The dataset is cleaned and prepared.  
2. A classification model is trained using Scikit-Learn.  
3. The trained model is saved and loaded inside a FastAPI app.  
4. The API is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.
